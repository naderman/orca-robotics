        WHAT IS EPE?

Quote follows from Garmin Engineering

Joe,

The EPE is an estimation based upon the information the  receiver 
can  determine.  SA  consists  of  artificial  clock  errors  and 
artificial  ephemeral errors. Both of these effects, as  well  as 
atmospheric  effects, can result in a positional area  of  uncer-
tainty, which can be measured and will add to the receivers  EPE. 
Bias errors cannot be measured and will typically not be detected 
in the EPE calculation. 

The 12XL will typically have a better EPE than other units due to 
the  12 channel correlator and the use of all tracked  satellites 
in the positional computation.

EPE  is  an  estimation,  rather  than  a  measurement,  but  all 
measurable  factors  are used in the estimation  algorithm.    We 
consider the details of our EPE and FOM calculations proprietary.

We  calculate  EPE  our  own way. URE  and  HDOP  are  definitely 
significant  factors in the calculation.   We calculate an  over-
determined solution,  and fully understand the characteristics of 
SA,  and  are  able  (in our opinion) to  provide  for  a  better 
estimate  of current position error than the simplistic  calcula-
tions will indicate. 

Many  folks  have and will demand to know our  specific  calcula-
tions,  but  we consider these to be proprietary and  we  do  not 
release  the  specific  formulas.  This is  similar  in  our  FOM 
calculation, we use a lot of finesse in our software which  other 
manufacturers  have not been able to duplicate. This  is  further 
evidenced  by  Dr. Wilson's reports on our accuracy  compared  to 
other receivers. If the tests were performed, I believe you would 
see closer correlation between our EPE values and actual  errors, 
as compared to other manufacturers units.

One  experimenter  has  found that about 2/3 of  the  time,   the 
ACTUAL error is less than the EPE readout on a Garmin 45 GPS unit 
tested.  Your figures may vary.  So..  EPE really is an  estimate 
not a guarantee or a measurement.

Sam Wormley offers the following additional information on EPE.

Garmin  does  not  give an explanation for  the  EPE  calculation 
displayed  on  a number of their handheld receivers.  EPE  is  an 
acronym for "Estimated  Position Error".  See page 18 of the  GPS 
12XL  Owner's Manual and Reference.  The behavior of EPE  is  not 
identical  on all of Garmin's receivers... some reflect the  dgps 
mode and others do not.

A  number  of  sources  indicate the error  in  position  can  be 
estimated  by the  simple calculation DOP * URA with  the  former 
calculated  in the GPS receiver from the geometry of  the  satel-
lites  used  in the position solution and the later  derived  and 
computed from the GPS message transmitted by each satellite. 

DOP  - Dilution of Precision - TDOP, PDOP, HDOP, VDOP, etc.  are, 
in  effect,  multipliers  that, when used with  some  measure  of 
positioning  statistic, can give you a realistic  expectation  of 
probability of error.

URA - User Range Accuracy - this is a quantity that is  transmit-
ted  in  the  navigation  message  that  is  the  predicted  (not 
measured) statistical ranging accuracy.  Since it is defined  for 
SPS (Standard Positioning Service), it  includes SA.

What does Garmin mean by EPE?  

EPE  =  HDOP  * URA (1-sigma)  would give a measure  of  the  68% 
confidence  circle, i.e., 68% of your position fixes  would  fall 
within and 32% would fall outside.

EPE  =  HDOP  *  URA (1-sigma) * 2 gives a  measure  of  the  95% 
confidence  circle,  i.e., 95% of your position fixes would  fall 
within and 5% would fall outside.

EPE  =  HDOP * URA (1-sigma) * 0.73 gives a measure  of  the  50% 
confidence  circle, i.e., 50% of your position fixes  would  fall 
within  and  50% would fall outside.  This is also known  in  the 
literature as CEP (Circular Error Probable).

This latter expression is what several of you have indicated that 
you think Garmin's EPE calculation is for the Garmin 12XL.  There 
may  also  be  an "EPE filter" to minimize the  EPE  figure  from 
jumping about to much.

There should be a "reasonable correlation" between HDOP and outer 
radial  position from a known geodetic point (could be determined 
over a long period  of time by statisical averaging).  I use  the 
word  "reasonable"  because the  comparison involves  the  points 
wandering  around mostly within a circle of  confidence,  whereas 
HDOP will relate to the radius of that circle of confidence.

=================================================================

To  further complicate the analysis, witout an  absolutely  clear 
view  of  the  sky,  you can expect the HDOP  to  take  jumps  as 
satellites  are  obstructed from view.  This might not be  a  bad 
idea to collect data under conditions less than desireable.  John 
Franke reports:

    "It  is  interesting  to  see  what  happens  under   certain 
     alinements.   I  recently had a case where the  receiver  (6 
     channel,  parallel) was tracking 4 satellites but was  doing 
     2D  NAV and the HDOP was 32.  A quick look at the  satellite 
     position  screen showed the 4 tracked satellites to be in  a 
     straight  line.  There were other satellites  available  but 
     the view to them was blocked by buildings.  So, knowing  the 
     orbits  repeat but are several minutes earlier each  day,  I 
     watched  the next day to see the alinement develop  and  the 
     PDOP change.  In less than twenty minutes the receiver  went 
     from  3D NAV with a PDOP of 2.3 to 2D NAV and a HDOP  of  30 
     back  to  3D  NAV and PDOP of  2.4!   Quite  impressive  and 
     educational to observe".

The  NMEA sentence $GPGGA recorded periodically over at  least  a 
twenty-four-hour  period  may  provide  enough  data  to  draw  a 
conclusion.   This is a good experiment for all to try  who  have 
the capability to capture data.... you will learn much.

Many  of you may have better approaches than mine to  gather  and 
analyse data to resolve the EPE issue.... and, of course it  goes 
without saying, we would hold Garmin in high[er] esteem if Garmin 
would  give a complete technical discription of the  calculation.  
And... if that technical language is over the typical  readership 
heads, I'm sure there are many qualified to translate.
